#  Coursera Deep Learning Specialization  
*A complete repository of notes, assignments, and implementations from the DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization.*


##  Overview  
This repository contains my organized work, practice notebooks, programming assignments, quiz solutions, and reference materials from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** (DeepLearning.AI).

The specialization provides a strong foundation in modern deep learning, covering neural networks, optimization techniques, CNNs, sequence models, and practical ML project structuring.
